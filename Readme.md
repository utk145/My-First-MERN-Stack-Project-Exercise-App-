# My First MERN Stack Project(Exercise App)

This is a full-stack web application built using the [MERN stack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE
) (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
## Backend
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve data. The following dependencies are used:

- dotenv: to load environment variables from a .env file
- express: to build the API endpoints
- mongoose: to interact with the MongoDB database

 ```
 # install dependencies
npm install

# start the server in production mode
npm start

# start the server in development mode with nodemon
npm run dev
```
## Frontend
The frontend is built using React.js. It communicates with the backend through API endpoints. The following dependencies are used:

- date-fns: to format and manipulate dates
- react: the core library for building the user interface
- react-router-dom: to handle client-side routing

To run the frontend, you can use the following commands:
```
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the development server
npm start

```
## Tech Stack
- MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based database service used to store user data
- Express.js: Backend web application framework used to build the API
- React.js: Frontend framework used to create a user-friendly interface
